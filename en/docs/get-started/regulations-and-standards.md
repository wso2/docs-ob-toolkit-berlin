Regulations and specifications are enforced by the authorities to standardise the open banking requirements and 
evaluate the open banking compliance in their region/country.

## Open banking regulations
Open banking regulations provide a policy and legislative framework to help banks and API consumers deliver the 
benefits of open banking. 

- The first known open banking regulation is the **Payment Service Directive** in Europe. This is administered by 
the European Commission (Directorate General Internal Market) which regulates payment services and payment service 
providers throughout the European Union and European Economic Area (EEA). PSD1 came into force in 2007 followed by PSD2 in 2015.
Listed below are some benefits of the PSD2:

    - The customers can manage their finances using third-party applications, For example, pay your bills using social media accounts. 
    - More consumer choices and better online and mobile payment methods.
    - More opportunities for fintech companies to introduce new and innovative banking services.
    - Enhanced payment security.
    - Ability to standardize the payment systems and impose limits on transaction fees to ensure lower costs for the consumers.

- The **Berlin Group** has been established as a pure technical standardisation body to define open and common standards 
of interoperable communications between banks and TPPs. The Berlin Group consists of several major players in the payment 
industry across the EU. Based on the PSD2 and European Banking Authority - Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) 
requirements, the Berlin Group has worked on a detailed Access to Account (XS2A) Framework named NextGenPSD2 with data 
models and associated messaging.

## NextGenPSD2
Alongside the regulations introduced in different regions, there are specifications to describe the implementation 
guidelines for the open banking requirements. [NextGenPSD2](https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads) was 
developed by the Berlin Group to define the interfaces that a TPP will use, as well as their technical features and 
security concerns. For more details

!!! note
     NextGenPSD2 Reference Toolkit is compliant with the Berlin Group's NextGenPSD2. 

## Other regulations and standards

- The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is a legal framework formalized in the European Union (EU) in 2016 
and comes into effect from 28, May 2018. GDPR effectively replaces the previously used EU Data Protection Directive (DPD).

- The European Banking Authority (EBA) published **Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS)**. PSD2 refers to RTS for 
technical guidance on authentication, authorisation, and other security aspects. RTS also defines when and how to apply 
Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) considering the requirements of PSD2. 

- **Financial-grade API (FAPI)** is an industry-led specification of JSON data schemas, security and privacy protocols 
to support use cases in the financial industry and other industries that require higher security. FinTech developers can 
accelerate secure open banking with FAPI. It uses OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) as its base and defines additional 
technical requirements.
