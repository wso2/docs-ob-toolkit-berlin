NextGenPSD2 Reference Toolkit 1.0 provides the technology requirements that banks need to digitally transform and become 
regulatory-compliant with Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) and the Berlin Group's NextGenPSD2 v1.3.6 specification.

This toolkit is based on WSO2 Open Banking 3.0 and contains specific feature customisations to satisfy open banking 
requirements of NextGenPSD2. You can use NextGenPSD2 Reference Toolkit to meet all legislative requirements 
with additional benefits beyond compliance. This toolkit comprises three modules:

- **WSO2 Open Banking Identity Server Berlin Toolkit** runs on top of WSO2 Identity Server.
- **WSO2 Open Banking API Manager Berlin Toolkit** runs on top of WSO2 API Manager.

For more information on WSO2 Open Banking Toolkit, see the [Get Started](open-banking.md) section.
