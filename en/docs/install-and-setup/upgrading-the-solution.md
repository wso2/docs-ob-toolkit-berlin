# Upgrading the solution

This document walks you through the process of upgrading your WSO2 Open Banking 2.0 setup to WSO2 Open Banking 3.0 (Accelerator Model).

## Why upgrade?

There are multiple reasons why you would want to upgrade the WSO2 product to the latest version. These reasons include but are not limited to the following.

- The current product version you are using is reaching its end of life. To see if this is the case, view the [support matrix documentation](https://wso2.com/products/support-matrix/).
- You want to leverage the new features of the latest version of the product.
- The version of the product you have does not have certain security and bug fixes that you require.

## What has changed?

Over the course of its lifetime, WSO2 Open Banking has changed significantly and some of the features you were using in an older version may not work the same way.

To learn whatâ€™s new in the NextGenPSD2 Reference Toolkit 1.0 release, see the [About this Release](../get-started/about-this-release.md) page.
