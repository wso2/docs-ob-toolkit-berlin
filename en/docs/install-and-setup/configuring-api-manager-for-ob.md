NextGenPSD2 Reference Toolkit contains TOML-based configurations. All the server-level configurations of the 
API Manager instance can be applied using a single configuration file, which is the `deployment.toml` file. 

## Configuring deployment.toml

Follow the steps below to configure the `deployment.toml` file and set up the open banking flow for WSO2 API Manager.

1. Replace the `deployment.toml` file as explained in the 
[Setting up the servers](setting-up-servers.md#copying-the-deploymenttoml) section.
 
2. Open the `<APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

3. Set the hostname of the API Manager:

    ``` toml
    [server]
    hostname = "<APIM_HOST>" 
    ```

4. Update the datasource configurations with your database properties, such as the username, password, JDBC URL for the 
database server, and the JDBC driver. 

    - Given below are sample configurations for a MySQL database. For other DBMS types and more information, 
    see [Setting up databases](setting-up-databases.md).
   
    ```toml tab='shared_db'
    [database.shared_db]
    url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbank_govdb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false"
    username = "root"
    password = "root"
    driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    ```
    
    ```toml tab='apim_db'
    [database.apim_db]
    url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbank_apimgtdb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false"
    username = "root"
    password = "root"
    driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    ```
    
    ```toml tab='config'
    [database.config]
    url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbank_am_configdb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false"
    username = "root"
    password = "root"
    driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    ```
    
    ```toml tab='WSO2UM_DB'
    [[datasource]]
    id="WSO2UM_DB"
    url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openbank_userdb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false"
    username = "root"
    password = "root"
    driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    ```

5. Update the following configurations with the hostname of the Identity Server.  
   
    ``` toml
    [apim.key_manager]
    service_url = "https://<IS_HOST>:9446${carbon.context}services/"
    ```
   
    ``` toml
    [apim.key_manager.configuration]
    ServerURL = "https://<IS_HOST>:9446${carbon.context}services/"
    ```

6. Update the hostname of the Identity Server in the following configuration:

    ``` toml
    [open_banking.gateway]
    consent.validation.endpoint="https://<IS_HOST>:9446/api/openbanking/consent/validate"
    ```

7. The `frequencyPerDay` value is sent in the consent initiation request body to indicate the requested maximum frequency 
   for access without PSU involvement per day. 

    - This enables request throttling according to the `frequencyPerDay` value provided in accounts initiation request.
    - For a request to be throttled, the TPP should initiate the request.

    a. To configure the custom throttling policy, enable the following configuration:

    ``` toml
    [open_banking_berlin.consent.freq_per_day]
    enable = true
    ```

    b. Deploy the throttling policy located in `<WSO2_OB_APIM_BERLIN_TOOLKIT_HOME>/repository/resources/frequencyPerDayPolicy` 
       as a custom throttling policy in the Admin Portal of WSO2 API Manager. 

    !!! note
            - Set the Throttle Key as follows:
            ```
            $customProperty.accountId:$customProperty.consentId:$userId:$customProperty.consumerKey
            ```
            - Set the Siddhi Query provided in the `<WSO2_OB_APIM_BERLIN_TOOLKIT_HOME>/repository/resources/frequencyPerDayPolicy` file.

            See [API Manager Documentation](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/4.0.0/design/rate-limiting/advanced-topics/custom-throttling/) for the instructions.

8. The supported signature algorithms and digest algorithms are used in `SignatureValidationExecutor` to perform signature verification and digest validation.

    - You can configure them using the following configurations.
    - You can configure any number of algorithms by separating them using a comma. 
    - By default, the following values are configured:

        ``` toml
        [open_banking_berlin.gateway.signature_verification]
        supported_hash_algorithms = ["SHA-256", "SHA-512"]
        supported_signature_algorithms = ["SHA256withRSA", "SHA512withRSA"]
        ```
    
9. By default, the following regex is used to validate the Organization ID:

    ```
    ^PSD[A-Z]{2}-[A-Z]{2,8}-[a-zA-Z0-9]*$
    ```
    
    You can override the above and use your own regex when validating the Organization ID of the TPP application. 
    Configure the required regex as follows:

    ```
    [open_banking.berlin.keymanager.org_id_validation]
    regex=”<CUSTOM_REGEX>”
    ```
    
    For more information, see [Customize Consumer Key Validation](../learn/tpp-onboarding-configuration.md)

10. Replace the existing `com.wso2.openbanking.accelerator.gateway.executor.impl.consent.ConsentEnforcementExecutor` configuration with the below configuration for all Accounts, Payments, and Funds Confirmations executor types.

    ```toml
    [[open_banking.gateway.openbanking_gateway_executors.type.executors]]
    name = "com.wso2.openbanking.berlin.gateway.executors.BerlinConsentEnforcementExecutor"
    priority = 7
    ```
    
    !!! note
         - Add this executor before `com.wso2.openbanking.berlin.gateway.executors.ErrorHandlingExecutor`.
         - Update the priority of the executor accordingly.

## Starting servers

1. Go to the `<APIM_HOME>/bin` directory using a terminal.

2. Run the `wso2server.sh` script as follows:

    ``` bash
    ./api-manager.sh
    ``` 

## Configure Identity Server as Key Manager

 1. Sign in to the Admin Portal of API Manager at `https://<APIM_HOST>:9443/admin`.
 2. Go to **Key Manager** on the left main menu. ![add_Key_Manager](../assets/img/get-started/quick-start-guide/add_Key_Manager.png)
 3. Click **Add New Key Manager** and configure Key Manager.
