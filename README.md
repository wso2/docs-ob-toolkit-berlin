## Prerequisites

To run the project locally, it requires [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) & [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

### Install Python

Check if you already have Python installed by running the following command.

```bash
$ python --version
Python 2.7.10
```

If you receive a response similar to the one shown above, `Python 2.7.10` is your default version.

You should also check if you have Python 3 installed. 

```bash
$ python3 --version
Python 3.8.0
```

If you don't seem to have `Python` installed, grab the latest release from the [official downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install pip

pip is already installed if you are using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or if you are working in a [Virtual Environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-and-using-virtual-environments) created by [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#virtualenv) or [pyvenv](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#venv). Just make sure to [upgrade pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#upgrading-pip).

#### Installing with get-pip.py

To install pip with `curl`, execute the following command. Alternatively you can download `get-pip.py` by clicking [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py). 

```bash
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```

Then run the following command in the folder where you have downloaded get-pip.py

```bash
$ python get-pip.py
```
